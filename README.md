# Tesis_GAM_RQ

This repository contains code used for evaluating trends in tropospheric ozone using **Generalized Additive Models (GAM)** and **Quantile Regression (RQ)**.

## 📊 Description

Hourly air quality data were processed into daily, monthly, and annual formats to apply the statistical models.  
The analysis was performed as part of a thesis project focused on air pollution trends.

## 🌐 Data Source

The data were obtained from the SINCA platform (https://sinca.mma.gob.cl/), selecting the desired monitoring station.  
There, you can access meteorological and pollutant variables.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jorkera7/Tesis_GAM_RQ.git
   cd Tesis_GAM_RQ
