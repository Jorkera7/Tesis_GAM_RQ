To use these codes, hourly data were used and processed into daily, monthly, and annual formats as needed.
The data can be obtained from the SINCA website (https://sinca.mma.gob.cl/) by clicking on the monitoring station. There, you'll find all available meteorological and pollutant variables.
Once you download the data, replace them in the inserted code.
